### üìå Instructions for Use

#### Manual Input
- **Input a single discrete math question** related to **sequences and summations**.
- Supported topics include:
  - Arithmetic sequences
  - Geometric series
  - Pattern identification
  - Summation notation (Œ£ notation)
  - Next-term prediction in sequences
- The question must be clear and precise. Avoid overly general or vague questions.

#### Example of a Valid Question:
- **"What is the 10th term in the arithmetic sequence: 3, 7, 11, 15, ...?"**
- **"Find the sum of the first 20 terms of the geometric series: 5, 15, 45, ..."**

#### Examples of Questions **NOT** Processed:
These questions **will not be processed** because they fall outside the scope of sequences and summations:
- **"What is the derivative of x^2?"** (calculus-related)
- **"Solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 5."** (algebra-related)
- **"What is the area of a circle with radius 7?"** (geometry-related)
- **"Write a program to compute factorials."** (programming-related)
- **"What is the capital of France?"** (general knowledge)

#### üìã CSV Upload
- Upload a **CSV file** containing a column of **discrete math questions** that follow the sequences and summations theme.
- The file should **not** contain any non-relevant questions or other types of math problems.

#### Example CSV Format:

| Question                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| What is the sum of the first 10 terms in the arithmetic sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, ...? |
| Find the next term in the geometric sequence: 3, 6, 12, 24, ... |
| What is the sum of the first 15 terms in the series: 10, 20, 40, ...? |
| Identify the pattern and find the 10th term: 5, 10, 20, 40, ... |
| What is the 8th term in the arithmetic sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, ...? |

#### Notes:
- Each row in the CSV should only contain a single question in plain text.
- Questions that are too short, malformed, or unrelated to the sequence and summation topics will be flagged as invalid.
- The maximum number of questions processed at once will depend on the file size and question length.

#### Important:
- **Questions that are too short** (e.g., "Find the sum of 1, 2, and 3.") or **unrelated** to sequences and summations will not be processed.
- Ensure your CSV file contains questions relevant to discrete math and summations.

### ‚ùó Example Invalid Questions in CSV:
| Question                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| What is the derivative of x^2?                     |
| Solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 5.            |
| What is the area of a circle with radius 7?        |
| Write a program to compute factorials.             |
| What is the capital of France?                     |

These types of questions will be **ignored** by the app, as they do not pertain to sequences and summations.
